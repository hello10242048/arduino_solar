Arduino Solar project: 
Website: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/FIELDING/solar-panel-sun-tracker-phone-charger-f669ce?ref=tag&ref_id=solar&offset=1
Objective:
1)	Making use of two servo motors to produce rotation with respect to x and y axis using wooden frame only
2)	Produce enough voltage for my S20 cell phone to charge

To-do: 
1)	Investigate the principle of phone charging, DC-DC boost converter, S20 battery specification: https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s20-10081.php
2)	Designing a circuit diagram for the whole set up(two LDRs for one direction only, two 10 kohm resistors, solar panels, DC-DC boost converter)
3)	anything you want to add
First zoom meeting:
Two-days later: 03/03, 9pm?
